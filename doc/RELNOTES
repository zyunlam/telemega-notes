Creating documentation for a new release of AltOS

* Write release notes in release-notes-${version}.inc. Add to Makefile

* Make sure that doc/altusmetrum.txt has the right copyright year

* Make sure doc/altusmetrum-theme.yml has the right copyright year

* Add references to that as appropriate from each of the documents:

	release-notes.inc
	easymini-release-notes.inc
	telegps-release-notes.inc

* Update version in main docs

	altusmetrum.txt
	easymini.txt
	micropeak.txt
	telegps.txt
	telemetry.txt

* Add release-notes-${version}.inc to git

* Make sure new hardware specs are documented in specs.inc
