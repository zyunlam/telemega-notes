Creating documentation for a new release of AltOS

* Write release notes in release-notes-${version}.inc. Add to
  Makefile

* Make sure that doc/altusmetrum-docinfo.xml has the right copyright 
  year, and add release to the revision history at the front (release 
  notes will be pulled in by release-notes.inc)

* Add references to that as appropriate from each of the
  documents:

	release-notes.inc
	easymini-release-notes.inc
	telegps-release-notes.inc

* Update date and add docinfo short release info for each document as
  appropriate

	altusmetrum-docinfo.xml
	companion-docinfo.xml
	easymini-docinfo.xml
	micropeak-docinfo.xml
	telegps-docinfo.xml
	telemetry-docinfo.xml

* Update copyright year as appropriate

	altusmetrum-docinfo.xml
	companion-docinfo.xml
	easymini-docinfo.xml
	micropeak-docinfo.xml
	telegps-docinfo.xml
	telemetry-docinfo.xml

* Add release-notes-${version}.inc to git
